Data was pre filtered on the website to include only colorectal and gastric cancer cell lines and drug screening data concerning HDAC inhibitors

Transcriptome data was downloaded from here:

Cell line pellets collected during exponential growth in RPMI or DMEM/F12 were lysed with TRIzol (Life Technologies) and stored at -70°C. Following chloroform extraction total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNAse digestion was followed by the RNAClean Kit (Agencourt Bioscience). RNA integrity was confirmed on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies) prior to labelling using 3’ IVT Express (Affymetrix). Resulting data was analyzed as described on the Human Genome U219 96-Array Plate using the Gene Titan MC instrument (Affymetrix). The robust multi-array analysis (RMA) algorithm (Irizarry et al., 2003) was used to establish intensity values for each of 18562 loci  (BrainArray v.10, (Dai et al., 2005)).

Raw data was finally deposited in ArrayExpress (accession number: E-MTAB-3610). The RMA processed dataset is available at http://www.cancerrxgene.org/gdsc1000//Data/preprocessed/Cell_line_RMA_proc_basalExp.txt.zip.
